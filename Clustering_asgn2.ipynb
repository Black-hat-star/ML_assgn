    "1)Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis that builds a hierarchy of clusters. It aims to create a tree-like structure (dendrogram) of nested clusters, where each data point is initially considered as a single cluster, and clusters are successively merged or split until a desired structure is achieved.
