    "4)The choice of encoding technique for categorical data with 5 unique values depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the machine learning algorithm. The two common encoding techniques for categorical data are one-hot encoding (nominal encoding) and ordinal encoding. Here's a brief explanation of each and when you might prefer one over the other:\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Hot Encoding (Nominal Encoding):\n",
    "\n",
    "Representation: Each unique category is represented by a binary column.\n",
    "Usage: Suitable for categorical variables with no inherent order or ranking (nominal data).\n",
    "Example: Colors (Red, Green, Blue) or Country Names (USA, Canada, Japan).\n",
    "Advantages: Preserves the independence of categories, and it's suitable when there is no ordinal relationship among the categories.\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Representation: Assigns a unique integer to each category based on a predefined order.\n",
    "Usage: Appropriate when there is an ordinal relationship among the categories.\n",
    "Example: Education Level (High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD).\n",
    "Advantages: Preserves ordinal information, and it might be useful for algorithms that can benefit from knowing the order of categories.\n",
    "Choice Based on Dataset:\n",
    "If your categorical data has 5 unique values and there is no inherent order or ranking among them, it's typically a good choice to use one-hot encoding (nominal encoding). This ensures that the machine learning algorithm does not incorrectly interpret any ordinal relationship among the categories.\n",
