    "2)Anomaly detection is a complex task, and there are several challenges associated with effectively identifying outliers or anomalies in different types of data. Some key challenges in anomaly detection include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomalies are typically rare events compared to normal instances. Imbalanced datasets, where normal instances significantly outnumber anomalies, can lead to biased models that are more sensitive to normal patterns.\n",
